# NexTrip Case Study

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Steps to build and run the application

- `yarn install && yarn start`
- Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### Steps to run tests

- `yarn test` to run jest unit tests
- `yarn run cypress` to open cypress integration tests. Once cypress window opens, click `NexTrip.spec.js`.

### Assumptions

- IE11 not supported
- Those who use this app are looking for departure information, meaning they are already familiar with the routes and where they are going and distance information
